# Welcome to Poyo Bot! 

The reason I made this bot is because I wanted to create a new experience for my Discord server.  
This bot is currently a work in progress and I am actively working on adding more functionality.  

---

## Features (so far)
- `!poyoball [question]` → Asks the bot a yes/no question and it responds in different ways based on emotion.
- `!ego` → Measures how big your or another users ego is as a joke 
- `!insult` → Utilizing an insult api, this command allows you to insult yourself or other users
- `!play_cope` → The bot joins and plays a prerecorded audio clip jokingly stating ("I knew the [NFL team here] were bad") , I thought this would be fun to add since my friends are huge NFL fans and to demonstrate the audio integration feature for Discord bots
- `!hack` → Lets you "hack" other users (NOTE: Does not really hack)
- `!tldr` → Utilizing the Hugging Face transformer model, the bot will generate a concise summary of a replied message.
